## Downloading code snapshots
You can download all the content of a branch via the "Code" button here on Github. You can then either clone the repository or simply download the selected branch content as a ZIP file.

Important: You always download the entire branch content!

You can then dive into the interesting folders (e.g. the individual code snapshots) locally on your hard drive.

## Running the attached code
You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).
